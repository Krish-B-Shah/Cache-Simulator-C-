Real-World Device Cache Simulation Results
==========================================

Device 1: Raspberry Pi 4 (Budget Embedded Device)
---------------------------------------------------
Processor: ARM Cortex-A72
L1 Data Cache: 32 KB
Line Size: 64 bytes
Associativity: 2-way set associative

Simulation Results:
- Cache Size: 32,768 bytes (32 KB)
- Line Size: 64 bytes
- Associativity: 2-way
- Policy: LRU
- Hits: 937 out of 1000 accesses
- Hit Rate: 93.70%

Device 2: Gaming Laptop (Intel Core i7-12700H)
-----------------------------------------------
Processor: Intel Core i7-12700H (2022)
L1 Data Cache: 48 KB per core (simulated as 64 KB)
Line Size: 64 bytes
Associativity: Fully associative (12-way approximated)

Simulation Results:
- Cache Size: 65,536 bytes (64 KB)
- Line Size: 64 bytes
- Associativity: Fully associative
- Policy: LRU
- Hits: 937 out of 1000 accesses
- Hit Rate: 93.70%

Analysis:
Both devices achieve identical hit rates (93.70%) despite different cache architectures.
The Raspberry Pi's 2-way associative cache performs as well as the fully associative
cache for this trace pattern, demonstrating that associativity may not always be the
limiting factor for certain access patterns.
